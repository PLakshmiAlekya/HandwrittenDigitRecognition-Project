# HandwrittenDigitRecognition-Project
#The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
#In order to run this project you will have to install jupyter notebook in your systems. After installing jupyter notebook, you can download the files and please create folders with the name of img and model in your folder in order to run the code successfully.
