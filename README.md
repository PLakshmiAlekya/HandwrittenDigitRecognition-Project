# HandwrittenDigitRecognition-Project

The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image using Tkinter library for building the GUI (Graphical User Interface).

To run this project, install the Jupyter notebook. After installing the Jupyter notebook, download the files and create folders with the name of 'img' and 'model' in a folder.
