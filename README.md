# HandwrittenDigitRecognition-Project
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Project using Tkinter library.
# About the Project
Handwritten Digit Recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits by creating our dataset. It is a task for the machine because handwritten digits are imperfect and made with different flavors. Handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem, which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

To run this project, install the Jupyter Notebook. After installing the Jupyter Notebook, download the files and create folders with the names 'img' and 'model' in a folder.
